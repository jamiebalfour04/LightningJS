# lightningJS
A HTML to AST parser.

This parser is based on the Zenith Parsing Engine. In fact, the code base that is used here was quite literally a conversion from Java to JavaScript. The parser is both fast and lightweight which is crucial. This is used as the basis of the clickit.education parser that converts HTML to blocks.
